## The Enhanced Interface for CORS

The Centralised Online Registration System (CORS) is a platform for students to bid or drop modules, and ballot or swap tutorial slots. We found the current interface to be rather clunky as it is all text based. In this project, we will create an interactive prototype of an enhanced version of CORS.
